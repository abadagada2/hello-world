# hello-world
This is just a test repository and my initiation into the github community.  Every noob must do this first.
I am a Linux Admin, ethical hacker, and social engineer who is attempting to break from being a newbie to a koolbie by reaching out to the extended community.  I also love programming in python, HTML, and CSS.  I look forward to talking with everyone in this community and learning as much I can from everyone here.
